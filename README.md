# SCEPMan
## Abstract
SCEPman shall implement a fully unattended Certificate Authority for Microsoft Intune based device certificate deployment described in [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/scep-libraries-apis) document:

“In Microsoft Intune, you can add third-party certificate authorities (CA), and have these CAs issue and validate certificates using the Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP). [Add third-party certification authority](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/certificate-authority-add-scep-overview) provides an overview of this feature, and describes the Administrator tasks in Intune.”

The intended implementation is a .net core C# based Azure WebApp providing the [SCEP](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-gutmann-scep-13) and Intune API, using [Bouncy Castle](https://www.bouncycastle.org) to implement the necessary certificate request handling and [Azure Key Vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/keyvault/) based RootCA and certificate signing. No other component should be involved, neither a database nor any other stateful storage except the Key Vault. That said, the concept will not need any backup procedures.

* Provide a description of the key, and a duration for the key. When done, select Save.
* After saving the key, the value of the key is displayed. Copy this value because you aren't able to retrieve the key later. You provide the key value with the application ID to sign in as the application. Store the key value where your application can retrieve it.
